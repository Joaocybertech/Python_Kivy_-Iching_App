This App has been built with python and kivy framework. In order to run it, you will have to download python and the kivy and kivyMD framework.

It is still an ongoing project, missing features are:

--> translating to english
--> compiling to android and ios
--> create explanations and classes of Iching Mei Hua or those who are begginers
--> create an LLM AI that can interpret aswers
--> change lines of hexagrams to images instead of using strings


If you want to contribute to the project, send me a message at joaocybertech@gmai.com
